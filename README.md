Ticket Management Booking Application is a Spring Boot project designed to perform complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for managing resources on a server. 
This project was my first hands-on experience with Spring Boot and JPA, built during my learning journey.

The application is designed with a modular architecture, allowing easy extension and scalability. While the backend is complete, the project has immense potential for further enhancements, 
such as integrating a modern UI for a complete user experience.

Features Includes-
Create: Add new tickets or resources to the system.
Read: Fetch detailed information about tickets or resources.
Update: Modify existing ticket or resource details.
Delete: Remove tickets or resources permanently from the system.
Technology Stack
Backend: Java, Spring Boot
ORM: JPA (Java Persistence API)
Database: MySQL
Build Tool: Maven
Language: Java

Future Scope
The project lays the foundation for a more comprehensive application. Some of the planned enhancements include:

User Interface: A fully functional UI using modern frameworks like React or Angular.
Authentication: Adding user authentication and role-based access.
API Documentation: Integration of Swagger for better API management.
Deployment: Hosting the application on a cloud platform like AWS or Azure.
